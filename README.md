# Lecture 08 Async Programming

This is a code sample to teach concepts of the threading and async programmimg. sample uses a block chain implementation as a shared resource.


|Branches|Details|
|-------|--------|
|Master| Use the live code to use during the class session|
|sync| Branch code uses a non thread blocking logic to show issues in UI update|
|async_thread| Branch code uses thread based implementation without semaphores to show thread synchronization issues|
|async_thread_semaphore| Branch code uses thread based implementation with semaphores to solve the synchronization issues|
|async_asynctask|Use of Async Task to simplify the solution|
